## smcsamplers

Implements SMC samplers to create figures for an article by Chenguang Dai, Jeremy Heng, Pierre E. Jacob, and Nick Whiteley, available on arXiv (or very soon).

This is not a general-purpose statistical software. This is just a collection of scripts intended to reproduce figures and tables of a paper. Use at your own risk! 

The folder inst/README.R explains which scripts to run to reproduce the figures.

### Installation

The package can be installed from R via:
```{r install, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("pierrejacob/smcsamplers")
```
It depends on the packages Rcpp, RcppEigen, tidyverse, doParallel, doRNG, ggplot2, ggridges, ggthemes..
